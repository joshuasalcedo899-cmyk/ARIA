ARIA: An Informative Augmented Reality Assistant for Front Desk Information Services

ARIA is a college capstone project developed as an Augmented Reality (AR) front desk assistant for STI College Calamba. The application is designed to provide students, visitors, and staff with quick, interactive, and accessible information without the need for a physical front desk personnel.
